# Engine modeling gaps — cross-unit thread inventory

> **AI-facing cross-unit triage map (CURRENT-STATE class — pruned as clusters resolve).** Derived by
> reading every unit's `unmodeled` + `caveats` in `data/kit-status.json` and grouping the recurring
> gaps, so a single engine fix can move a whole cluster instead of chasing per-unit residuals. NOT a
> decision log — the capability-build WHY lives in `docs/DECISIONS.md`, the live flag/primitive state
> in `docs/STATE.md` §1/§5, and the per-unit SSOT in `data/kit-status.json`. This doc = "these N units
> share one root cause" + which built primitives are still un-enacted per unit.
>
> **Ratio direction (see docs/CONVENTIONS.md):** board = `sim/real`. **HOT ▲ = sim over-credits**
> (ratio > 1); **COLD ▼ = sim under-credits** (ratio < 1).

## 2026-07-20 — blind-rebuild three-way audit cross-check (74 packets + rei-ayanami)

> The full roster was run through the blind-rebuild three-way audit (`scripts/blind-rebuild/`:
> blind rebuild → sighted full-context review → reconciling judge vs the formula SSOT). 76 result
> files, **avg faithfulness 0.95**, 106 gotchas (45 FIDELITY / 33 ENGINE / 24 ENCODING / 4 SILENT_DROP;
> 25 high). The audit found **no new engine primitive** beyond the 19 themes above — its value is
> independent confirmation that this inventory is complete, plus unit-level enactment detail and a
> handful of stale-caveat corrections. Per-kit detail: `docs/handoffs/2026-07-20-kit-audit-implementation-plan.md`.

**Independent confirmations of existing themes** (audit reached the same conclusion from code-only):

- **Theme 8 (hitRatePct live):** the audit re-derived `hitRatePct → acrForHR` core lift from code on
  every AR/SMG/SG unit and flagged the overrides that still carry a **stale "hitRatePct inert" caveat**
  predating the 2026-07-19 CONE_DELTA landing. **Stale-caveat corrections needed (7 overrides):**
  `miranda`, `modernia`, `nayuta`, `noir`, `quency-escape-queen`, `soda-twinkling-bunny`, `trina`
  (each review's "inert in the engine" note is now wrong; the stat is live for AR/SMG/SG; MG/SR/RL keep
  the flat base table). Documentation-only fix; no engine change.
- **Theme 12 / U13 (function-rider crit): CLOSED 2026-07-22 — `RIDERCRIT` default ON.** The
  `extraHitDamagePct` path now crits at caster rate per SSOT §2b (never cores; FB by landing time was
  already correct). Population was exactly three overrides — `modernia`, `nayuta`, `neon-vision-eye` —
  all kit-verbatim coefficients, none calibrated-absorbed, so no de-credit was applied. → A32 (U13),
  DECISIONS 2026-07-22. **Residual gap at the same call site (NOT crit):** `extraHitDamagePct` generates
  no burst gauge while an equivalent `flatDamage` proc emits `skillGauge` per proc, and it is a summed
  stat so a per-rider `flavor` (e.g. a true-damage rider, which must not crit) cannot be represented.
  The gauge half is **LIVE on all three carriers today** (they generate less gauge than the same kit
  line would under `flatDamage`, and the one measured function rider DOES generate gauge — so it is a
  probable under-generation, not a neutral unknown); the flavor half is genuinely inert (no
  true-flavored rider exists). Either way the two encodings are not interchangeable; swapping one for
  the other on a unit silently changes its gauge economy. → U28.
- **Theme 13 (ally-granted Max HP inert, e3):** audit re-confirmed ally-granted `casterMaxHpPct`/
  `targetMaxHpPct` do not feed a teammate's `atkOfMaxHpPct` (rouge/noir/trina), neutralizing the
  Max-HP double-counts as damage-irrelevant.
- **Themes 3/4/5/7/11/14:** audit re-confirmed stack-ramp (3), conditional/team-gated buffs (4: naga
  shield-gate, mint mode-default), pierce gating (5: prika missing Gains Pierce = the one SILENT_DROP-class
  pierce finding), weapon-swap economy (7), excludeSelf (11), flat Max-Ammo (14: noir +5 self-only) on the
  relevant units.

**Genuinely-new unit-level findings surfaced by the audit** (not previously itemized):

- `prika` — continuous "Gains Pierce" (while in Performance) is unmodeled and no `hasPierce` tag is carried
  → her own Pierce Damage ▲13.09% never lands (SILENT_DROP-class; theme-5 enactment, COLD 0.691).
- `snow-white` — "Full Charge Damage: 1000% of damage" encoded as multiplicative ×10 (chargeMultPct 1000
  → 4995%/full shot) AND swap shot economy capped at exactly 1 cannon shot/burst (engine zeroes charge-speed
  during swap) — two high ENGINE/ENCODING items.
- `tove` — team-wide Critical Rate modeled at stale 3.32% vs current in-game 10.08% (~3× too low) + burst
  ATK-buff duration 10s vs 15s — two stale-datamine-value FIDELITY fixes (separate from hitRatePct).
- `asuka-wille` — "Anti A.T. Field status is removed after the effect is triggered" represented nowhere
  (SILENT_DROP). `rapi-red-hood` / `miranda` also carry a SILENT_DROP-class line each.

## Highest-leverage engine fixes (ranked by blast radius)

Systematic limitations, not per-unit fudge — each corrects many units at once. Capability-build detail
+ board deltas are in DECISIONS (dates below); live flag/primitive state in `docs/STATE.md`. Compact:

1. **Per-tick recovery-event emitter** (theme 2b) — ✅ CAPABILITY LANDED 2026-07-17 (`heal.ticks`/
   `intervalSec` + `recoveryEmitters` queue; opted in anchor-innocent-maid, blanc). Open HoT backfill:
   prika/trina/mint (no `heal` block yet); naga/mana instant; anis-star dropped.
2. **`excludeSelf` on typed-ally targets** (theme 11) — ✅ LANDED 2026-07-17 (maiden-ice-rose 1.55→1.03;
   brid-silent-track/miranda/soda-twinkling-bunny faithful, board-neutral).
3. **`hitRatePct` → core-hit lift** (theme 8) — ✅ LIVE BY DEFAULT 2026-07-17 (`HRCORE`). Open refinements:
   asuka saturation bracket; quency-escape-queen cadence + the +1.04 overshoot; slope validation.
4. **Own-burst-gated FB** (theme 9) — ✅ LANDED 2026-07-17 (`ownBurstGate:'cast'/'notCast'`; opted in
   cinderella-crystal-wave T8 1.062→1.001, T5 1.009→0.978). diesel-winter-sweets `'notCast'` expressible,
   owner-deferred.
5. **Swap weapon datamine spec** (theme 7) — ✅ CAPABILITY LANDED 2026-07-17 (`weaponSwap.weapon`/
   `pullsPerSec`; nayuta 0.637→0.894). moran throughput footage-blocked; chisato/takina/velvet HOT-unaddressed.
6. **`bossElementGate` block gate** (theme 10) — ✅ LANDED 2026-07-17 (helm-aquamarine Electric rider,
   brid-silent-track Wind debuffs; inert vs the neutral scope-lock boss). Advantage BUFFS never needed it
   (`elemAdvantageDamagePct` is already advantage-gated in the damage math).
7. **Timed / swap-scoped pierce** (theme 5) — ✅ CAPABILITY LANDED 2026-07-17 (`gainPierce` +
   `pierceUntilFrame`; grave enabled 0.83→1.18 HOT kept on purpose, faithful>fit, residual → U19).
   milk-blooming-bunny/prika deferred. (Pierce Damage ▲ applies on the partless boss; only the pierce
   CORE+BODY double-hit is multipart-only — don't conflate.)
8. **Cadence-tuple measurement** (theme 1) — largest population (~22 units), a measurement backlog owned
   by the full-sweep video plan, not an engine change.

## Full theme catalog (ranked by unit count)

### 1. Cadence-tuple datamine estimates — ~22 units

Class-default fire rate / `reloadFrames` / charge frames / SR-RL 22-frame bolt-gap shipped
unverified on every non-focus-recorded unit ("⚑ cadence tuple"). Direction unknown per unit but
empirically large: guillotine-winter-slayer ~26% HOT on normal fire; jill 1.67→1.02 was pure
cadence. Sub-flags: SR/SMG autofire-vs-bolt-gap unknown (ade-agent-bunny, mari, red-hood, velvet);
rolling reload is unmodeled and, as of 2026-07-22, **unassignable** — `reload_start_ammo` is
`max_ammo − 1` on all 192 shot rows (it never flagged modernia or volume, or anyone) and the
varying field `reload_bullet` is measured-refuted as a restored-fraction (grave, noir). Footage
is the only identifier; jill is the sole known carrier → open-questions **U30**.
Units: ade-agent-bunny, anchor-innocent-maid, anis-sparkling-summer, arcana, asuka, asuka-wille,
bready, elegg-boom-and-shock, guillotine-winter-slayer, helm-aquamarine, laplace, liter,
ludmilla-winter-owner, mana, mari, modernia, quency-escape-queen, raven, sakura-bloom-in-summer,
scarlet, soline-frost-ticket, volume.

### 2. Defensive / heal / shield with no engine vocabulary — ~25 units

No HP pool → lifesteal, shields, overheal buffers, taunt, invuln, Indomitability are inert/dropped.
Mostly neutral for the unit itself (v1 boss deals no damage).
Units: ada, alice, anchor-innocent-maid, asuka, asuka-wille, blanc, crown, delta-ninja-thief, grave,
little-mermaid, maiden-ice-rose, mana, moran, naga, nayuta, neon-vision-eye, prika, red-hood, rouge,
soline-frost-ticket, trina, zwei, mihara-bonding-chain, mint, anis-star.

#### 2b. Per-tick heals collapsed to one event → breaks on-recovery consumers (COLD uptime)

A repeated "hard rule 2" violation: dropping/collapsing a heal breaks the recovery-trigger synergy
chain (Crown's "when recovery takes effect"). **Single-fix candidate #1 — ✅ CAPABILITY LANDED
2026-07-17** (`heal.ticks`/`intervalSec` + `recoveryEmitters` queue; see ranked fix #1 above). Opted
in: anchor-innocent-maid (ticks:8), blanc (ticks:5 / ticks:8). Remaining units carry their HoT heals
as UNMODELED (prika/trina) or no heal block (mint) or instant heals (naga/mana) or dropped (anis-star)
— convert per-unit when touched.
Units: anchor-innocent-maid ✅, blanc ✅, prika, mint, naga, trina, anis-star, mana.

### 3. Stack-ramp buffs baked to max, not time-averaged — ~13 units (HOT) — ⚙️ ENGINE CAPABILITY LANDED 2026-07-17

Per-shot/per-charge stacking frozen at cap from t=0 → over-credits opening seconds.
Units: ade-agent-bunny, arcana-fortune-mate (~+8–10%), chisato, cinderella, guilty, leona,
mast-romantic-maid, mihara-bonding-chain, laplace, soda-twinkling-bunny, red-hood, rouge,
sakura-bloom-in-summer.

**Capability:** the `buff` effect now carries optional `rampSec` (types.ts). When a buff's value is
authored at its MAX-stacks magnitude but the real stacks accrue over the opening seconds, `rampSec`
linearly ramps its contribution `0 → full` over `rampSec` from the buff's FIRST application, then holds
at cap (sim.ts `sum()` chokepoint scales `value*stacks` by `min(1, (frame-startFrame)/rampFrames)`).
The ramp clock is the first-apply frame (frame 0 for a `passive`, the cast frame for a burstCast-keyed
self-buff) and is NOT reset by refreshes. Omit → instant-to-max (back-compatible). **NOW ENACTED on 2
units (2026-07-17) — no longer inert/byte-identical:** **cinderella** (`casterMaxHpPct 19.2, rampSec 36`
for her battle-start Beautiful Max-HP + the `flatDamage 346.8, rampSec 36` Beautiful-mirror split; steady
state t≥36s byte-identical to the old bake, pre-36s bursts now credit partial Beautiful — this is the
source of the current cinderella regression-snapshot drift, understood/documented in her caveats) and
**arcana-fortune-mate** (3× `rampSec 11` on her Making-Memories stack buffs — the 2/4/6-shot phase counter
caps at ~11s ≥ the window, so each ramps 0→full and resets per window). Verified end-to-end earlier:
injecting a temporary `rampSec:8` on red-hood's 10s burst ATK ▲71.42% moved her PA-MiKa total 799M→786M
(0.936→0.921), the expected opening-seconds de-credit.
**NOT auto-enacted:** each unit's `rampSec` is a ⚑ per-unit estimate — enacting moves the board (these are
HOT), so it is measurement/Fable-gated per unit (scientific-method harness). **Do NOT double-correct the
units that already hand-average their ramp in the override note** — cinderella (Beautiful baked `2.71×1.192`
steady-state), soda-twinkling-bunny (Golden-Chip time-average, measured against `soda tb control.mov`), and
arcana-fortune-mate (Making-Memories phases baked to max within her FB window, which resets per window — a
plain continuous ramp is the WRONG shape for her). The clean first candidates are the battle-long monotonic
ramps (chisato/leona/guilty/mast-romantic-maid/red-hood charge-stack/sakura-bloom-in-summer). The faithful
alternative for any unit whose accrual is cleanly one-stack-per-shot stays re-authoring the buff with its
real incremental trigger (`shotFired`/`hitCount`/`chargeCounter` + `maxStacks`) — the engine already ramps
stacks for those; `rampSec` is the time-average approximation for when per-shot authoring is impractical.

### 4. Conditional / team-gated buffs modeled as always-satisfied — ~11 units (HOT) — ⚙️ TEAM-COMP GATE CAPABILITY LANDED 2026-07-17

Gate ("at max stacks", "while shielder present", "same-squad ally", "Wheel of Fortune") not encoded,
defaults to always-on.
Units: arcana, arcana-fortune-mate, asuka, naga (shield-gate fires unconditionally, 1.175 HOT),
guilty, leona, noir, anchor-innocent-maid.

#### 4b. Kit-silent trigger → invented 100%-uptime (HOT)

No "Activates when…" clause → author invented a proxy.
Units: helm-aquamarine, liter, mari, rosanna-chic-ocean (TOP flag; also removed a fabricated
permanent casterAtkPct), snow-white, isabel.

**PREMISE CORRECTION (2026-07-17) — this theme is a RECONCILIATION backlog, not one missing primitive.**
Reading every unit's `kit-status.json` finding + override showed the gates here are MOSTLY ALREADY
EXPRESSIBLE, and several units are already fixed: **asuka** (fires-only-with-a-healer → already the
`recovery` trigger), **snow-white** (already `shotFired`+`swapGate`), **rosanna-chic-ocean** (fabricated
permanent `casterAtkPct` already removed; residual = 1 invented-uptime S2 trigger), **naga**
("while shielder present" → the `{kind:shielded}` trigger + 3 live emitters blanc/crown/delta-ninja-thief
already exist; her over-credit is currently neutralized by the `auto` mode default, theme 17). **guilty's**
"at max stacks" rider is expressible via `resourceGate` once her stacks are modeled as a resource.
The residual work is per-unit override reconciliation that is BOARD-MOVING (HOT) with an open magnitude
question, so it is measurement/Fable-gated — NOT an autonomous inert-landing like themes 3/5/6/7. Routed
to the kit-parse owner-reconciliation backlog.

**The one genuinely-inexpressible gate WAS the team-composition predicate** ("dead without a Burst-III
Electric caster present" — the `arcana` RL/Electric override; NOT arcana-fortune-mate). ✅ **CAPABILITY
LANDED 2026-07-17:** a static block gate `teamHas:{element?/class?/weapon?/burst?}` (types.ts Block;
evaluated at sim setup in the sim.ts block filter alongside `formation`/`mode`). Facets AND together;
the block is active only when SOME OTHER ally matches ALL of them (owner never counts, same rule as
`formation`; burst matches literally so a Λ unit ≠ 'III'). Omit = always active → **inert until an
override opts in** (regression byte-identical, verified by a stash A/B of the two touched files against
the pre-existing working-tree snapshot). Verified end-to-end by injecting a `teamHas`-gated +100% ATK
self-buff on a focus unit: fires with a matching present ally (Water/Electric/B3 → +57%), correctly
inert when absent (Wind → 0%), correctly inert when only self would match (owner excluded → 0%).
**No override opts in yet** — enacting arcana is deferred (MODEL_ONLY, no board data; owner currently
grades her "mono-Electric comp only", and her separate Wheel-of-Fortune status gate is still unmodeled).

### 5. Pierce gating — static `hasPierce` only — ~14 units (usually COLD)

Timed / swap-scoped / HP-gated pierce was inexpressible → dead blocks ("modeled ≠ working"). **✅ TIMED
pierce now expressible (`gainPierce`, 2026-07-17 — see ranked fix #7).** Pierce Damage ▲ is a real
Damage-Up-bucket entry that applies to any pierce-damage-type unit, on the partless boss too (only the
pierce CORE+BODY DOUBLE-HIT is multipart-only — `PIERCE_CORE_DOUBLE=false`; don't conflate). grave is
ENABLED with faithful pierce (0.83→1.18 HOT kept on purpose, faithful>fit); the residual HOT is a separate
burst-window over-model, now cleanly isolated as open-questions U19. Units: alice, d-killer-wife,
grave (ENABLED; residual = burst-window over-model, U19), mari, milk-blooming-bunny (dead block, 0.70 COLD),
prika, red-hood, snow-white, snow-white-heavy-arms, zwei, laplace, maxwell, naga, mana.

### 6. Parts / core branches inert on the partless v1 boss — ~11 units

Mostly correctly inert; the one **live HOT bug** — d-killer-wife's parts branch `coreDamagePct 16.26`
staying LIVE in-sim (core hits exist on a partless boss) → over-crediting every ally's core bucket —
✅ **FIXED 2026-07-17**: removed as SKIPPED-CONDITIONAL (kit "Allies that hit parts…", parts-gated,
unearnable on the partless boss); body branch `casterAtkPct 12.19` kept. d-killer-wife 1.055 HOT → 0.998,
takina 1.047 → 0.988; board within-±3% 5→6 (DECISIONS 2026-07-17).
Units: d-killer-wife (HOT bug — FIXED), diesel-winter-sweets, laplace, raven, rosanna-chic-ocean,
sakura-bloom-in-summer, red-hood, snow-white-heavy-arms, mari, asuka, diesel.

### 7. Weapon-swap burst-window economy — ~12 units (mixed) — ⚙️ ENGINE CAPABILITY LANDED 2026-07-17

The `weaponSwap` effect now carries per-swap `pullsPerSec` (fire cadence) + `weapon` (class) overrides
so a swap can load its OWN datamine spec (fix #5). `effWeapon = swap.weapon ?? char.weapon` drives
range-band + auto-core; a swap `pullsPerSec` governs the non-charge fire cadence. Both inert until an
override opts in.

- **nayuta ✅ FIXED (0.637 → 0.894):** swap shots were range/core-banded as base **SMG**; set
  `weapon:'SR'` (Memory Incineration is an SR mode) → +30% range in midfar/far + HI core, the bands
  the finding flagged. MAD 0.342→0.106 (DECISIONS 2026-07-17).
- **moran ⛔ REFUTED then MEASURED — stays base 12/s; coldness is a THROUGHPUT follow-up (footage-blocked):**
  the datamined swap ROF 1440 = 24 pulls/s was applied but the board REFUTED it (0.712 → 1.325 HOT). Backed
  out, then MEASURED (`moran control.mov`, 60fps): swap fires base ~12/s. The "1440" was an unlabeled
  `skill_value`. Coldness DIAGNOSED as throughput, not per-shot: her measured popup reconciles EXACTLY to
  14.7% × Crown/Helm-buffed final ATK (recon 30,478 = 14.71% × 131,441 × 1.5723, 0.3%) — per-shot faithful,
  buffs modeled. But sim 217M vs real 288M ⇒ ~1.3× more HITS than modeled (~1.5× throughput in the swap
  window) — faster swap fire-rate OR >1 bullet/pull, NOT isolable from the comp footage. ⇒ FOLLOW-UP: needs
  an isolated moran-solo recording or the swap weapon's `shot_count` datamine (DECISIONS 2026-07-17).
  Others still optimistic/HOT (unaddressed): chisato, takina (~1.044), velvet (~1.068), red-hood,
  snow-white, laplace, maxwell, zwei, volume.

### 8. `hitRatePct` → core-hit-rate lift — ✅ LIVE BY DEFAULT 2026-07-17

Was engine-inert; now a live core-hit-rate lift (`HRCORE`, sim.ts:830 — a live Hit Rate shrinks the
reticle → higher core fraction; `ENV.HRCORE=0/off` disables for A/B). jill measured core 0.20→0.90.
OPEN refinements only (not a capability gap): asuka's saturation bracket, quency-escape-queen's cadence +
the +1.04 overshoot, slope validation via a measurement (e.g. `soda-tb-control`). Related still-open:
tove (crit-rate stale 3.32→10.08) is a separate crit-rate fix, not hitRatePct.
Units affected: anchor-innocent-maid, drake, leona, modernia, noir, quency-escape-queen,
soda-twinkling-bunny, jill, nayuta.

### 9. Own-burst-gated vs team-FB trigger (schema gap) — ~7 units (HOT in multi-B3) — ✅ CAPABILITY LANDED 2026-07-17

"Entering Full Burst after this unit uses her own Burst" was modeled as plain team `fullBurstEnter`.
**RESOLVED** via the `ownBurstGate: 'cast' | 'notCast'` block gate (see ranked fix #4). Opted in:
cinderella-crystal-wave (both FB-enter core-strike riders → `'cast'`; T8 1.062→1.001, T5 1.009→0.978,
NOT the sole-B3-inert the finding assumed — she alternates stage-3 with a co-B3 in both graded comps,
so the gate is board-moving and IMPROVES fit). arcana-fortune-mate / mana / asuka-wille (the reference)
already correctly use `burstCast` for their duration self-buffs (no FB-entry instant to preserve);
mihara-bonding-chain is a benign sole-B3; chisato has no FB-enter own-burst line. The inverse COLD case
diesel-winter-sweets (0.831, `'notCast'` Highlight sustained) is now EXPRESSIBLE but owner-deferred
(document-only; her full Highlight state machine + no-op-B3-drives-FB path is the larger unmodeled piece).

### 10. Boss-element-gated debuffs/buffs inert vs neutral scope-lock boss — ~8 units

`bossElement` couldn't compose with `fullBurstEnter`/`hitCount`/`burstCast`. Big team-wide lever on
matched bosses. **✅ RESOLVED for the element-CODED triggered lines 2026-07-17** (`bossElementGate`
block gate — see ranked fix #6): helm-aquamarine (Electric burst rider) + brid-silent-track (two Wind
team debuffs) opted in. The element-ADVANTAGE buffs (anis-sparkling-summer, guillotine-winter-slayer,
elegg-boom-and-shock, asuka) never needed it — `elemAdvantageDamagePct` is already advantage-gated in
the damage math. eve keeps the permanent `bossElement` trigger.
Units: anis-sparkling-summer, asuka, brid-silent-track ✅, eve, guillotine-winter-slayer,
helm-aquamarine ✅, elegg-boom-and-shock.

### 11. `excludeSelf` not honored on typed-ally targets — ✅ LANDED 2026-07-17

"arcana-fortune-mate bug family". **Single-fix candidate #2 — DONE.** Engine now honors `excludeSelf`
on `allies`/`alliesTopAtk`/`alliesOfElement`/`alliesOfClass` (sim.ts:resolveTargets; the pool is
filtered BEFORE any top-N slice). Overrides opted in against verified `data/characters.json` prose:
maiden-ice-rose (alliesOfElement Electric "except for self" → 1.55 HOT collapsed to 1.03, MAD 0.253→0.098),
brid-silent-track (burst `allies` "except self"), miranda (2× alliesTopAtk "except the skill user"),
soda-twinkling-bunny (alliesTopAtk "except the skill user"; self covered by its own self-block).
arcana-fortune-mate was already fixed for `alliesOfWeapon`. False positives ruled out: blanc/mana carry
"except self" on lowest-HP / incapacitated targets (unmodeled theme-13/18 lines, not these kinds).
Verify: full gate green; regression snapshot updated (2 maiden comps, both understood).

### 12. DoT / periodic damage crit — PER-DoT, evidence-gated (isabel ✅ LANDED 2026-07-17)

Ties to open-question U13. **Resolution: NOT a global flip.** A universal DOT*CRIT default-on was
MEASURED-REFUTED — a board sweep (DOTCRIT off→on) is a wash (±3%: 8→8) and breaks units whose DoTs
are \_validated non-crit*: jill's acid tick is video-confirmed 99.7% NON-crit, mihara-bonding-chain's
Ensnaring is validated at 1.03 non-crit, little-mermaid's FB dot/barrage carry no crit evidence. So
DoT crit is now a **per-DoT `crit:true` opt-in** (types.ts dot effect + `Dot.crit`; the tick site
falls back to the still-OFF global DOT_CRIT gate when unset) — enabled ONLY where measured.

- **isabel ✅ LANDED** — her ~14.7s periodic rider crits in-game (MEASURED: 3 crits / 11 resolved
  fires; crit 308,564 = non-crit 205,709 ×1.5 exactly, `docs/probe-data/isabel-sg-band.json`
  riderFinding). `crit:true` on her skill2 dot; rider now rolls at her sheet rate (solo recon warms
  the right direction, ~50.9M→53.1M vs real 55.3M). Zero board blast radius (solo-only unit; per-DoT
  field leaves every other unit byte-identical). DECISIONS 2026-07-17.
- **neon-vision-eye** — the "~7% cold" claim is STALE: she reads +8% HOT on the current board and is
  UNAFFECTED by DOT_CRIT (no critting DoT in her kit). NOT a theme-12 unit; her heat belongs elsewhere.
- **modernia** — her cold is NOT DoT-crit: both her S1 `flatDamage` rider and her burst Destroy-Mode
  `extraHitDamagePct` rider crit (the latter since `RIDERCRIT`, 2026-07-22 — worth ~+12% on that term
  via her Critical Damage ▲ 14.25%×5 stacks, which moved her 0.83→0.84). She remains COLD; the residual
  is elsewhere and is not a DoT tick.
- eve Mk2 sequential-doubling caveat still open (separate).

### 13. Max-HP-scaling grants with no stat key / no lowest-HP targeting — ~6 units ✅ LANDED 2026-07-17

"Max HP ▲ X% of user's Max HP" and "affects lowest-remaining-HP ally" have no primitive. Matters only
on HP-scaling teammates. Units: anis-star, blanc, rouge (double-counted 44.5 vs 30.02, HOT), trina,
maiden-ice-rose, moran.

**LANDED (kit-completeness sweep):** two primitives added — `targetMaxHpPct` StatKey ("Max HP ▲ X%",
target's OWN %, distinct from the existing `casterMaxHpPct` = "% of the skill user's Max HP") and the
`alliesLowestHp` TargetDef (count/excludeSelf; no HP pool in v1 → resolves to the leftmost `count` allies
as a documented deterministic stand-in). Both honor the e3 rule (ally-granted Max HP feeds a consumer's
`atkOfMaxHpPct` ONLY when caster === target, i.e. self). Per-unit: **maiden-ice-rose** self "Max HP ▲6.34%
×10, every 6 full charges" now modeled (targetMaxHpPct on self, hitCount 6, maxStacks 10, 15s) — the ONE
offensively-live grant (self-fed): her N6 Wind comp 0.76→0.85 (board-verified, +11.6% her total; snapshot
updated maiden-N6 only). anis-star (burst 15.02% all-allies, hasB1), trina (S2 44.98% Electric-AR allies +
burst 20.14% all-allies), blanc (burst 31.68% lowest-HP ally) — all ally-facing, **offensively INERT**
(e3), modeled for kit-SSOT completeness (proven 0.000% board delta on all teammates incl. cinderella).
rouge already had casterMaxHpPct grants. moran's Max-HP lines are HP<20%-gated (theme 18, never fire) —
intentionally left as skips. See DECISIONS 2026-07-17.

### 14. Flat-rounds Max-Ammo inexpressible (percent-only schema) — ~5 units — ✅ CAPABILITY LANDED 2026-07-17

A new `maxAmmoFlat` StatKey (types.ts) expresses "Max Ammunition ▲ N round(s)" as a flat round count,
added on top of the `maxAmmoPct` scaling in `maxAmmo()` (`round(base*(1+pct/100)) + flat`). Applied as
a plain `buff` (usually `passive` → self, or an all-allies target for the team grants), so it composes
with triggers/targets like any other stat. **Inert until an override opts in** (no unit sets it →
`stat(u,'maxAmmoFlat')` sums 0 → byte-identical `maxAmmo()`; verified by an isolated A/B of the
`maxAmmo()` edit against the working tree: regression totals identical). Functional check: injecting a
temporary `maxAmmoFlat 200` passive on a low-mag AR lifted pulls 1099→1908 (fewer reloads → more shots,
+65% total), the expected direction. **NOT auto-enacted:** the listed units currently APPROXIMATE the flat
grant as a percent (noir `maxAmmoPct 55.56` self-only for +5 all-allies; trina `maxAmmoPct 33.3` for +20
assuming a 60-round base; grave +3, tove +2, drake), and converting to the faithful flat form is
board-MOVING (noir's +5 becomes team-wide; the others change the exact round count) → measurement/owner-gated
per unit, routed to the kit-parse reconciliation backlog.
Units: grave (+3), noir (+5 all-allies → modeled self-only), tove (+2), drake, trina (+20).

### 15. Ammo-dump / forced-reload "Removes 100% of ammo" inexpressible — 3 units — ✅ CAPABILITY LANDED 2026-07-17

A new `consumeAmmo` effect (types.ts; the inverse of `instantReload`) drains the target's belt by
`fraction` of MAX capacity (default 1 = the whole magazine) and, if it empties, forces an immediate reload
— firing the target's `lastBullet` triggers exactly as if it had fired dry (sim.ts `applyEffect`).
**Inert until an override opts in** (no unit references it → regression byte-identical). Functional check:
injecting a temporary per-shot `consumeAmmo` collapsed pulls 1099→96 (constant forced reloads eat fire time,
−89% total), the expected direction. **NOT auto-enacted:** the three units need per-unit trigger authoring
(grave = Prediction/burst-window END forced reload, the documented comp-COLD cause; asuka-wille + jill on
their own kit triggers) + board verification → deferred to the reconciliation backlog.
Units: asuka-wille, grave (Prediction-end forced reload, comp-cold cause), jill.

### 16. TREASURE-phase prose SSOT gap — 5 units (RESOLVED 2026-07-17)

Sync carried no favorite-item prose → materialize froze untreasured base kit. helm anchor
0.591→1.014. Units: helm, laplace, moran, miranda, drake. Watch on any newly-synced treasure unit.

### 17. User-selected modes vs auto-detection — 8 units (config-driven board misreads)

Team-comp branches via a manual `modes` field (first entry = default) → board misreads that look like
model bugs but are config bugs (mint 0.768 was a config default, not a model error). The 8 `modes`
overrides: bready, cinderella-crystal-wave, delta-ninja-thief, elegg-boom-and-shock, milk-blooming-bunny,
mint, naga, prika. **Triage note: check the selected mode against the recorded comp before counting one
of these as a modeling defect.**

**2026-07-17 — `auto` no-op default added to 4 units** (bready, delta-ninja-thief, elegg-boom-and-shock,
naga): a new first-entry `auto` mode that no block is tagged to, so it applies NO mode-custom kit config
(only untagged blocks fire). This makes the default a neutral baseline instead of silently applying an
unverified branch — e.g. naga's default was `with shielder` (fires `coreDamagePct 85.17` + burst
`casterAtkPct`); `auto` drops both (72.1M → 63.3M unpinned, neutralizing the 1.175 HOT over-credit).
verify.sh stayed green (board/regression comps pin their mode explicitly). Still branch-default (owner
review pending): cinderella-crystal-wave (`MG`_/`Snipe`, pierce only in Snipe), the mint↔prika duet pair
(`solo`_/`duet` — mutually referencing, flip both together), milk-blooming-bunny (`auto (no Embarrassment)`\*
already a no-op-style default). Full action item + per-unit mode inventory: CLAUDE.md NEXT INCREMENT
backlog (new item 6).

### 18. Kill-gated / revive / boss-death effects that never fire — ~4 units

Immortal solo boss. Units: volume (kill-gated ATK ▲12.6% can never trigger), mana, mihara-bonding-chain,
moran.

### 19. SG pull-vs-pellet `hitCount` 10× lever + per-unit SG landing — SG cluster

"After N attacks" ambiguous between pulls and pellets (10× proc-cadence swing); per-unit pellet
landing not captured by the class table. Units: drake (explicit 10× lever), soline-frost-ticket, noir,
arcana-fortune-mate, isabel (per-unit SG landing residuals). Per-unit landing is CLOSED by owner override
(open-questions **A31 (U17)** — the class table stands, class-wide far 0.66 rejected); the open tail is
isabel's mid/midfar clock-drift re-derive (**U27**). The pull-vs-pellet 10× lever stays open.

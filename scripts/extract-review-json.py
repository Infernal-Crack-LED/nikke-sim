"""Rescue the verdict JSON out of a cross-family dispatch log.

The `/code-review` and `/logic-gate` bridges (scripts/kit-autonomy/dispatch-*.sh) normally
write a clean result JSON. When a dispatch instead leaves only a raw session log — the
model narrated its tool calls around the verdict, or the bridge died after the model
answered — this pulls the verdict back out instead of re-spending the dispatch.

Two input shapes are accepted, because both occur:
  * a session log — a JSON envelope with a `result` string holding the model's full output
    (tool call/result blocks, then the final JSON verdict, usually inside a ```json fence);
  * that output text on its own — what dispatch-*.sh saves as `<out>.raw.txt` when its own
    jq validation rejects the extracted candidate.

    python3 scripts/extract-review-json.py <log-path> <out-path> [--model NAME]

<log-path>   the dispatch session log (e.g. ~/.kimi-code/sessions/<wd>/<session>/agents/
             main/tasks/<task>/output.log), a bridge-saved `<out>.raw.txt`, or `-` for stdin
<out-path>   where to write the extracted verdict, e.g.
             scratchpad/gates/<date>-<topic>/result.json
--model      stamp `model` on the verdict. The bridges inject this themselves; set it only
             when rescuing a log the bridge never stamped, and use the CANONICAL name from
             scripts/kit-autonomy/CROSS-FAMILY-PROTOCOL.md — an off-protocol `model` voids
             the review.

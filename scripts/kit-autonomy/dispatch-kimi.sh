# dispatch-kimi.sh — dispatch a cross-family packet to Kimi via the CLI.
#
#   bash scripts/kit-autonomy/dispatch-kimi.sh <packet.md> <model> <result-out.json>
#
# Kimi equivalent of dispatch-claude.sh, with the same two modes, selected by
# the packet's role heading in its first 10 lines:
#
#   BLIND (default — every packet that does not start with "# code-review"):
#     runs the blind agent profile (kimi-blind-agent.md, `tools: []`), which
#     leaves the model with no tools at all (verified 2026-07-26: it cannot
#     read files), and prepends the no-tools preamble. Generic gates may
#     override the profile with KIMI_AGENT_FILE (e.g. logic-gate's
#     scripts/gates/kimi-gate-agent.md — also `tools: []`).
#
#   CODE-REVIEW (packet starts with "# code-review"):
#     the sighted post-op review (.claude/skills/code-review). Runs the sighted
#     profile (kimi-code-review-agent.md, `tools: [Read, Grep, Glob, Bash]`)
#     and omits the no-tools preamble. Write/Edit are NOT in the profile — the
#     reviewer stays findings-only (Bash is governed by the role body's "never
#     edit, never mutate" instruction). Detection WINS over KIMI_AGENT_FILE: a
#     code-review packet always gets the sighted profile even if the caller
#     still exports the old blind gate profile.
#
# Both modes prepend the subagent non-negotiables, run the full prompt through
# `kimi -p`, extract the assistant text from the stream-json envelope, strip
# markdown fences, validate it parses as JSON, and write to <result-out.json>.
#
# The model field is injected into the result so the verdict can report provenance.
#
# Model names are config.toml aliases, e.g. `kimi-code/k3` (see
# scripts/kit-autonomy/CROSS-FAMILY-PROTOCOL.md for the canonical routing).
#
# NOTE: --agent-file requires the v2 engine in -p mode, hence
# KIMI_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_FLAG=1 below. Long dispatches (a ~44KB blind packet)
# take minutes — carve this script out of any short STOP-DON'T-WAIT timeout,
# same as dispatch-claude.sh.

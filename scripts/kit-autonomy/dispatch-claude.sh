#
# Two modes, selected by the packet's role heading in its first 10 lines:
#
#   BLIND (default — every packet that does not start with "# code-review"):
#     kit-autonomy audits, scientific-method, logic-gate, etc. Prepends the
#     no-tools preamble and dispatches with tools DISABLED (--allowedTools
#     "DISABLED"), preserving the blindness boundary — the role cannot read the
#     driver's artifacts or the repo; the packet is all it sees.
#
#   CODE-REVIEW (packet starts with "# code-review"):
#     the sighted post-op review (.claude/skills/code-review). Omits the
#     no-tools preamble and dispatches with READ-ONLY repo access
#     (--allowedTools "Read,Grep,Glob,Bash", --max-turns 12 so the reviewer can
#     actually read callers and run typecheck/tests). Write/Edit are NOT on the
#     allow-list — the reviewer stays findings-only (Bash is governed by the
#     role body's "never edit, never mutate" instruction).
#
# Both modes prepend the subagent non-negotiables, pipe the full prompt to
# `claude -p`, extract the model's JSON from the CLI envelope, strip markdown
# fences, validate it parses as JSON, and write to <result-out.json>.
#
# The model field is injected into the result so the verdict can report provenance.
